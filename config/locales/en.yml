          description: "Technologies here are what we are using consistency across most, if not all, projects & teams. In general, you should use these unless you have a <strong>very</strong> good reason not to. <strong>Not</strong> using technologies here would be a technical risk."

          title: "Trial"
          description: "Technologies in production now, but not consistently across the team. These are worth pursuing, but we haven't yet rolled them out team-wide. They are great choices for projects where a solution doesn't exist in the <em>Adopt</em> ring. Prefer these over those in <em>Assess</em>."

It's a guide for making technical decisions without having to have the entire team sync up on everything.

          preamble: "When using the radar, you may be tempted to suggest changes to it. You shouldn't. The radar is changed on a regular basis based on experience found since the last update. Try to stick to the radar for your day-to-day work, and keep notes on how things go. We want the radar to be generally stable, but able to evolve."
